        <p>Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of California-Los Angeles, where I am funded in part by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF DGE-2034835). Before coming here, I graduated with B.A.s in Linguistics, Eurasian Studies, and Russian from the University of Oklahoma, where I was a National Merit Scholar and Global Engagement Fellow.</p>
